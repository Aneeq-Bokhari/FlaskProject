<P align="center">God of War is an upcoming third-person action-adventure video game in development by Santa Monica Studio and to be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) console. It will be the eighth installment in the God of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's God of War III. The game will be a soft reboot for the franchise and will take the series to the world of Norse mythologyâ€”all previous games were based on Greek mythology. Series protagonist Kratos will return as the main character, and he now has a son. Kratos acts as a mentor and protector to his son, and has to master the rage that has driven him for many years.</p>
